        "Q1. Explain the main components of client-server architecture and their functions.\n",
        "   - Client-server architecture is a computing model where multiple clients (users or devices) request and receive services from a central server. This model is widely used in networks, applications, and web-based systems. The main components and their functions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Client\n",
        "The client is a device (computer, smartphone, or application) that initiates requests to the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides the user interface and interacts with the server to retrieve or send data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, email clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Server\n",
        "The server is a powerful machine or program that processes client requests and delivers the required resources or services.\n",
        "\n",
        "It hosts databases, applications, and files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of servers: Web server, database server, file server, application server.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Network\n",
        "The network connects clients and servers, enabling communication between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be a Local Area Network (LAN) or the Internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Communication happens via protocols like HTTP (web), FTP (file transfer), and TCP/IP (general networking).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Database (Optional but Common)\n",
        "Stores and manages data requested by clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can be on the same machine as the server or a separate database server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Middleware (Optional)\n",
        "Acts as a bridge between clients and servers, facilitating communication and data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Often used in complex architectures like multi-tier systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: API gateways, authentication systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works\n",
        "The client sends a request to the server (e.g., a user enters a URL in a web browser).\n",
        "\n",
        "The server processes the request, fetches data (if needed), and prepares a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "The server sends the response back to the client (e.g., loading a webpage).\n",
        "\n",
        "The client displays the received data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.  Discuss the various career paths available after completing a web development course\n",

        "\n",
        "Every commit has a timestamp and author, making it easy to track modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Collaboration & Teamwork\n",
        "Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Git supports branching and merging, allowing different features or bug fixes to be developed separately and integrated later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) make collaboration across teams seamless.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Branching & Experimentation\n",
        "Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once tested, changes can be merged into the main branch (e.g., main or master).\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps in feature isolation and structured development.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Backup & Security\n",
        "The project is stored in distributed repositories, preventing data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if a local copy is lost, the remote repository (e.g., GitHub) has a backup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensures code integrity and prevents accidental deletion.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Faster Development & CI/CD Integration\n",
        "Git integrates with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can push changes and trigger automatic builds, tests, and deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduces manual work and speeds up the development lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Code Review & Quality Control\n",
        "Teams can use pull requests (PRs) and code reviews before merging changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps maintain code quality and ensures best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enables discussions and feedback before making changes permanent.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Resolving Conflicts Efficiently\n",
        "Git provides tools to detect and resolve merge conflicts when multiple developers edit the same file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Developers can review changes before finalizing merges.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Open Source & Community Support\n",
        "Git is free, open-source, and widely adopted.\n",
        "\n",
        "It has a large community and extensive documentation, making problem-solving easier.\n",
        "Q5.  Compare and contrast a text editor and an IDE, highlighting their key features and uses.\n",
        "    - A text editor is a lightweight tool used for writing and editing code, offering basic features such as syntax highlighting, simple auto-completion, and extensibility through plugins. It is fast, consumes minimal system resources, and is ideal for quick edits and small projects. Popular text editors include VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, and Vim. On the other hand, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive software suite that provides a full range of development tools, including a code editor, compiler, debugger, version control integration, and project management features. IDEs, such as PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio, are best suited for complex, large-scale applications that require extensive debugging and testing. While text editors prioritize speed and simplicity, IDEs offer advanced functionalities that enhance productivity but may be heavier on system resources. The choice between a text editor and an IDE depends on the project's complexity and the developer's workflow preferences."
